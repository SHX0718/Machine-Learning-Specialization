    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Welcome to machine learning!\n",
    "Welcome to Machine learning. What is machine learning? You probably use it many times a day without even knowing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you want to find out something like how do I make a sushi roll? You can do a web search on Google, Bing or Baidu to find out. And that works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank web pages. Or when you upload pictures to Instagram or Snapchat and think to yourself, I want to tag my friends so they can see their pictures. Well these apps can recognize your friends in your pictures and label them as well. That's also machine learning. Or if you've just finished watching a Star Wars movie on the video streaming service and you think what other similar movies can I watch? Well the streaming service will likely use machine learning to recommend something that you might like. Each time you use voice to text on your phone to write a text message. \"Hey Andrew, how's it going?\" Or tell your phone, \"Hey Siri play a song by Rihanna\", or ask your other phone, \"okay Google show me Indian restaurants near me\".That's also machine learning. Each time you receive an email titled, Congratulations! You've won a million dollars. Well maybe you're rich, congratulations. Or more likely your email service will probably flag it as spam. That too is an application of machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond consumer applications that you might use, AI is also rapidly making its way into big companies and into industrial applications. For example, I'm deeply concerned about climate change, and I'm glad to see that machine learning is already hoping to optimize wind turbine power generation. Or in healthcare, is starting to make its way into hospitals to help doctors make accurate diagnosis. Or recently at Landing AI have been doing a lot of work, putting computer vision into factories to help inspect if something coming off the assembly line has any defects. \n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>That's machine learning, it's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed</mark>. In this course, you learn about machine learning and get to implement machine learning and code yourself. Millions of others have taken the earlier version of this course, which is of course, that led to the founding of Coursera. And many learners ended up building exciting machine learning systems or even pursuing very successful careers in AI. I'm excited that you're on this journey with me. Welcome and let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Applications of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, you'll learn about the state of the art and also practice implementing machine learning algorithms yourself. You'll learn about **the most important machine learning algorithms**, some of which are exactly what's being used in large AI or large tech companies today and you get a sense of what is the state of the art in AI. Beyond learning the algorithms though, in this class, you'll also learn **all the important practical tips and tricks for making them perform well**. You get to **implement them and see how they work** for yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is machine learning so widely used today? Machine Learning had grown up as a sub-field of AI or artificial intelligence. We wanted to build intelligent machines. It turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from a to b, like in your GPS. But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car. The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "*For me, when I founded and was leading the Google Brain Team, I worked on problems like speech recognition, computer vision for Google Maps, Street View images and advertising, or leading AI Baidu, I worked on everything from AI for augmented reality to combating payment fraud to leading a self-driving car team. Most recently, at landing.AI, AI Fund and Stanford University, I'm beginning to work on AI applications in the factory, large-scale agriculture, health care, e-commerce, and other problems. Today, there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people working on machine learning applications who could tell you similar stories about their work with machine learning.* When you've learned these skills, I hope that you too will find the great fun to dabble in exciting different applications and maybe even different industries. In fact, I find it hard to think of any industry that machine learning is unlikely to touch in a significant way now or in the near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking even further into the future, many people, including me, are excited about the AI dream of someday building machines as intelligent as you or me. This is sometimes called **Artificial General Intelligence** or **AGI**. I think AGI has been overhyped and we're still a long way away from that goal. I don't know. It'll take 50 years or 500 years or longer to get there. But mostly AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer toward that goal is by using **learning algorithms**. Maybe ones that take some inspiration from how the human brain works. You also hear a little more about this Quest for AGI later in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to a study by McKinsey, AI and machine learning is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030. Even though machine learning is already creating tremendous amounts of value in the software industry, I think there could be even vastly greater value that has yet to be created outside the software industry in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials manufacturing, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the massive untapped opportunities across so many different sectors, today there is a vast unfulfilled demand for this skill set. That's why this is such a great time to be learning about machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find machine learning applications exciting, I hope you stick with me through this class. I can almost guarantee that you'll find mastering these skills worthwhile. In the next video, we'll look at a more formal definition of what is machine learning. And we'll begin to talk about the main types of machine learning problems and algorithms. You pick up some of the main machine learning terminology and start to get a sense of what are the different algorithms and when each one might be appropriate. So let's go on to the next video.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 What is machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "What is machine learning? In this video, you'll learn the definition of what it is and also get a sense of when you might want to apply it. Let's take a look together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a definition of what is machine learning that is attributed to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as <mark>the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed</mark>. Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing program. The amazing thing about this program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was he had programmed the computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. By watching what social support positions tend to lead to wins and what positions tend to lead to losses the checkers plane program learned over time what are good or bad suport positions by trying to get a good and avoid bad positions, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers because the computer had the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself. It was able to get so much checkers playing experience that eventually it became a better checkers player than also, Samuel himself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now throughout these videos, besides me trying to talk about stuff, I occasionally ask you a question to help make sure you understand the content. Here's one about what happens if the computer had played far fewer games. Please take a look and pick whichever you think is the better answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for looking at the quiz. If you had selected this answer would have made it worse then you got the right. In general, the more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform. If you didn't select the correct answer the first time, that's totally okay too. The point of these questions isn't to see if you can get them all correctly on the first try. These questions are here just to help you practice the concepts you are learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arthur Samuel's definition was a rather informal one but in the next two videos, we'll dive deeper together into what are the major types of machine learning algorithms? In this course, you learn about many different learning algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two main types of machine learning are **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. We'll define what these terms mean more in the next couple of videos. Of these two, supervised learning is the type of machine learning that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation. In this specialization, which has three courses in total, **the first and second courses will focus on supervised learning**, and **the third will focus on unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning**. By far, the most used types of learning algorithms today are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems. The other thing we're going to spend a lot of time on in this specialization is practical advice for applying learning algorithms. This is something I feel pretty strongly about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching about learning algorithms is like giving someone a set of tools and equally important, so even more important to making sure you have great tools is making sure you know how to apply them because like is it is somewhere where it gives you a state-of-the-art hammer or a state-of-the-art hand drill and say good luck. Now you have all the tools you need to build a three-story house. It doesn't really work like that and so too, in machine learning, making sure you have the tools is really important and so is making sure that you know how to apply the tools of machine learning effectively. That's what you get in this class, the tools as well as the skills to apply them effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "I regularly visit with friends and teams in some of the top tech companies, and even today I see experienced machine learning teams apply machine learning algorithms to some problems, and sometimes they've been going at it for six months without much success. When I look at what they're doing, I sometimes feel like I could have told them six months ago that the current approach won't work and there's a different way of using these tools that will give them a much better chance of success. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, one of the relatively unique things you learn is you learn a lot about the best practices for how to actually develop a practical, valuable machine learning system. This way, you're less likely to end up in one of those teams that end up losing six months going in the wrong direction. In this class, you gain a sense of how the most skilled machine learning engineers build systems. I hope you finish this class as one of those very rare people in today's world that know how to design and build serious machine learning systems. That's machine learning. In the next video, let's look more deeply at what is supervised learning and also what is unsupervised learning. In addition, you'll learn when you might want to use each of them, supervised and unsupervised learning. I'll see you in the next video.\n",

    "Machine learning is creating tremendous economic value today. I think 99 percent of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning. Let's take a look at what that means. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-2-2.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that **learn x to y or input to output mappings**. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that **you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from, that includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output**. Let's look at some examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-2-3.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input $X$ is an email and the output $Y$ is this email, spam or not spam, this gives you your spam filter. Or if the input is an audio clip and the algorithm's job is output the text transcript, then this is speech recognition. Or if you want to input English and have it output to corresponding Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, or something else translation, then that's machine translation. Or the most lucrative form of supervised learning today is probably used in online advertising. Nearly all the large online ad platforms have a learning algorithm that inputs some information about an ad and some information about you and then tries to figure out if you will click on that ad or not. Because by showing you ads they're just slightly more likely to click on, for these large online ad platforms, every click is revenue, this actually drives a lot of revenue for these companies. This is something I once done a lot of work on, maybe not the most inspiring application, but it certainly has a significant economic impact in some countries today. Or if you want to build a self-driving car, the learning algorithm would take as input an image and some information from other sensors such as a radar or other things and then try to output the position of, say, other cars so that your self-driving car can safely drive around the other cars. Or take manufacturing. I've actually done a lot of work in this sector at learning AI. You can have a learning algorithm takes as input a picture of a manufactured product, say a cell phone that just rolled off the production line and have the learning algorithm output whether or not there is a scratch, dent, or other defect in the product. This is called visual inspection and it's helping manufacturers reduce or prevent defects in their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these applications, you will **first train your model with examples of inputs $X$ and the right answers, that is the labels $Y$**. After the model has learned from these input, output, or $X$ and $Y$ pairs, they can then **take a brand new input $X$, something it has never seen before, and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output $Y$**. Let's dive more deeply into one specific example. \n",

    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-2-4.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to predict **housing prices** based on the **size of the house**. You've collected some data and say you plot the data and it looks like this. Here on the horizontal axis is the size of the house in square feet. Yes, I live in the United States where we still use square feet. I know most of the world uses square meters. Here on the vertical axis is the price of the house in, say, thousands of dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this data, let's say a friend wants to know what's the price for their 750 square foot house. How can the learning algorithm help you? One thing a learning algorithm might be able to do is say, for the straight line to the data and reading off the straight line, it looks like your friend's house could be sold for maybe about, I don't know, $150,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "But fitting a straight line isn't the only learning algorithm you can use. There are others that could work better for this application. For example, routed and fitting a straight line, you might decide that it's better to fit a curve, a function that's slightly more complicated or more complex than a straight line. If you do that and make a prediction here, then it looks like, well, your friend's house could be sold for closer to $200,000. One of the things you see later in this class is how you can decide whether to fit a straight line, a curve, or another function that is even more complex to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it doesn't seem appropriate to pick the one that gives your friend the best price, but one thing you see is how to get an algorithm to systematically choose the most appropriate line or curve or other thing to fit to this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you've seen in this slide is an example of supervised learning. Because w**e gave the algorithm a dataset in which the so-called right answer**, that is the label or the correct price $Y$ is given for every house on the plot. **The task of the learning algorithm is to produce more of these right answers**, specifically predicting what is the likely price for other houses like your friend's house. That's why this is supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define a little bit more terminology, this housing price prediction is the particular type of supervised learning called **regression**. By regression, I mean **we're trying to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers** such as the house prices in our example, which could be 150,000 or 70,000 or 183,000 or any other number in between. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's supervised learning, learning input, output, or $X$ to $Y$ mappings. You saw in this video an example of regression where the task is to predict number. But there's also a second major type of supervised learning problem called classification. Let's take a look at what that means in the next video.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Supervised learning part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-3-1.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output or $X$ to $Y$ mapping. And in the last video you saw that regression algorithms, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm learns to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers. There's a second major type of supervised learning algorithm called a **classification algorithm**. Let's take a look at what this means. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-3-2.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Take breast cancer detection as an example of a classification problem. Say you're building a machine learning system so that doctors can have a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer. This is important because early detection could potentially save a patient's life. Using a patient's medical records your machine learning system tries to figure out if a tumor that is a lump is malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous. Or if that tumor, that lump is benign, meaning that it's just a lump that isn't cancerous and isn't that dangerous? Some of my friends have actually been working on this specific problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe your dataset has tumors of various sizes. And these tumors are labeled as either benign, which I will designate in this example with a $0$ or malignant, which will designate in this example with a $1$. You can then plot your data on a graph like this where the horizontal axis represents the size of the tumor and the vertical axis takes on only two values $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the tumor is benign, $0$ or malignant, $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that this is different from regression is that we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories. In this case two possible outputs $0$ or $1$, benign or malignant. This is different from regression which tries to predict any number, all of the infinitely many number of possible numbers. And so the fact that there are only two possible outputs is what makes this classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are only two possible outputs or two possible categories in this example, you can also plot this data set on a line like this. Right now, I'm going to use two different symbols to denote the category using **a circle or an $O$ to denote the benign examples** and **a cross to denote the malignant examples**. And if new patients walks in for a diagnosis and they have a lump that is this size, then the question is, will your system classify this tumor as benign or malignant? \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-3-3.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that in classification problems you can also have more than two possible output categories. Maybe you're learning algorithm can output multiple types of cancer diagnosis if it turns out to be malignant. So let's call two different types of cancer type 1 and type 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the average would have three possible output categories it could predict. And by the way in classification, the terms output classes and output categories are often used interchangeably. So what I say **class** or **category** when referring to the output, it means the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize classification algorithms predict categories. Categories don't have to be numbers. It could be non numeric for example, it can predict whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog. And it can predict if a tumor is benign or malignant. Categories can also be numbers like 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2. But what makes classification different from regression when you're interpreting the numbers is that **classification predicts a small, finite, limited set of possible output categories** such as 0, 1 and 2 but not all possible numbers in between like 0.5 or 1.7. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-3-4.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of supervised learning that we've been looking at, we had only one input value the size of the tumor. But you can also use more than one input value to predict an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example, instead of just knowing the tumor size, say you also have each patient's age in years. Your new data set now has two inputs, age and tumor size. What in this new dataset we're going to use circles to show patients whose tumors are benign and crosses to show the patients with a tumor that was malignant. So when a new patient comes in, the doctor can measure the patient's tumor size and also record the patient's age. And so given this, how can we predict if this patient's tumor is benign or malignant? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, given the day said like this, what the learning algorithm might do is find some boundary that separates out the malignant tumors from the benign ones. So the learning algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line through this data. The boundary line found by the learning algorithm would help the doctor with the diagnosis. In this case the tumor is more likely to be benign. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this example we have seen how to inputs the patient's age and tumor size can be used. In other machine learning problems often many more input values are required. My friends who worked on breast cancer detection use many additional inputs, like the thickness of the tumor clump, uniformity of the cell size, uniformity of the cell shape and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-3-5.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap supervised learning maps input $X$ to output $Y$, where the learning algorithm learns from the quote right answers. The two major types of supervised learning are $regression$ and $classification$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a regression application like predicting prices of houses, the learning algorithm has to predict numbers from infinitely many possible output numbers. Whereas in classification the learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you now know what is supervised learning, including both regression and classification. I hope you're having fun. Next there's a second major type of machine learning called unsupervised learning. Let's go on to the next video to see what that is\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Unsupervised learning part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-4-1.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning. Let's take a look at what that means. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-4-2.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about supervised learning and this video is about unsupervised learning. But don't let the name uncivilized for you, unsupervised learning is I think just as super as supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align='center'>\n",
    "    <img src='static/images/2-4-3.png' width=70%>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're looking at supervised learning in the last video recalled, it looks something like this in the case of a classification problem. Each example, was associated with an output label $Y$ such as benign or malignant, designated by the Os and crosses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, **we're given data that isn't associated with any output labels $Y$**, say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age. But not whether the tumor was benign or malignant, so the dataset looks like this on the right. We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we're not given any labels $Y$ in the dataset, instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data. \n",

    "This is unsupervised learning, we call it unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm. To give some quote right answer for every input, instead, we asked the our room to figure out all by yourself what's interesting, or what patterns or structures that might be in this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this particular data set, an unsupervised learning algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters. And so it might decide, that there's one cluster what group over here, and there's another cluster or group over here. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a particular type of unsupervised learning, called a **clustering algorithm**. Because it places the unlabeled data, into different clusters and this turns out to be used in many applications. \n",

    "For example, clustering is used in google news, what google news does is every day it goes. And looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet, and groups related stories together. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a sample from Google News, where the headline of the top article is Giant panda gives birth to rear twin cubs at Japan's oldest zoo. This article has actually caught my eye, because my daughter loves pandas and so there are a lot of stuff panda toys and watching panda videos in my house. And looking at this, you might notice that below this are other related articles. Maybe from the headlines alone, you can start to guess what clustering might be doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the word panda appears here here, here, here and here and notice that the word twin also appears in all five articles. And the word Zoo also appears in all of these articles. So the clustering algorithm is finding articles all of all the hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet that day, finding the articles that mention similar words and grouping them into clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what's cool is that this clustering algorithm figures out on his own which words suggest, that certain articles are in the same group. What I mean is there isn't an employee at google news who's telling the algorithm to find articles that the word panda and twins and zoo to put them into the same cluster, the news topics change every day and there are so many news stories, it just isn't feasible to people doing this every single day for all the topics that use covers. Instead the algorithm has to figure out on his own without supervision, what are the clusters of news articles today. So that's why this clustering algorithm, is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm. \n",

    "Let's look at the second example of unsupervised learning applied to clustering genetic or DNA data. This image shows a picture of DNA micro array data, these look like tiny grids of a spreadsheet and each tiny column represents the genetic or DNA activity of one person. So for example, this entire column here is from one person's DNA and this other column is of another person, each row represents a particular gene. So just as an example, perhaps this role here might represent a gene that affects eye color, or this role here is a gene that affects how tall someone is. Researchers have even found a genetic link to whether someone dislikes certain vegetables, such as broccoli, or brussels sprouts, or asparagus. So next time someone asks you why didn't you finish your salad, you can tell them, maybe it's genetic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For DNA microarrays, the idea is to measure how much certain genes are expressed for each individual person. So these colors red, green, gray, and so on, show the degree to which different individuals do, or do not have a specific gene active. And what you can do is then run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into different categories or different types of people. Like maybe these individuals that group together, and let's just call this type one. And these people are grouped into type two, and these people are groups as type three. This is unsupervised learning, because we're not telling the algorithm in advance, that there is a type one person with certain characteristics or a type two person with certain characteristics. Instead, what we're saying is here's a bunch of data. I don't know what the different types of people are but can you automatically find structure into data and automatically figure out whether the major types of individuals, since we're not giving the algorithm the right answer for the examples in advance. This is unsupervised learning. \n",

    "Here's the third example. Many companies have huge databases of customer information. Given this data, can you automatically group your customers into different market segments ,so that you can more efficiently serve your customers. \n",

    "Quite briefly, the deeplearning.ai team did some research to better understand the deeplearning.ai community and why different individuals take these classes, subscribed to the batch weekly newsletter, or attend our AI events. Let's visualize the deeplearning.ai community, as this collection of people running clustering that is market segmentation, found a few distinct groups of individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "One group's primary motivation is seeking knowledge to grow their skills. Perhaps this is you, and so that's great. A second group's primary motivation is looking for a way to develop their career. Maybe you want to get a promotion or a new job, or make some career progression if this describes you, that's great too. And yet another group wants to stay updated on how AI impacts their field of work, perhaps this is you, that's great too. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clustering that our team used to try to better serve our community as we're trying to figure out what the major categories of learners in the deepleaerning.ai community. So if any of these is your top motivation for learning, that's great. And I hope I'll be able to help you on your journey. Or in case this is you, and you want something totally different than the other three categories. That's fine too, and I want you to know, I love you all the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize a clustering algorithm, which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters. And so maybe the next time you see or think of a panda, maybe you think of clustering as well. And besides clustering, there are other types of unsupervised learning as well. Let's go on to the next video, to take a look at some other types of unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
