Say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age, but not whether the tumor was benign and malignant. So the dataset looks like this on the right. We not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant because we're not given any labels Y in the dataset. Instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern, or just find something interesting in the data. This is unsupervised learning.\n",

Instead, we ask the algorithm to figure out all by itself what's interesting or what patterns or structures there might be in this data. With this particular dataset, an unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters. This is a particular type of unsupervised learning called a clustering algorithm because it palces the unlabeled data into different clusters"

I don't know what the different types of people are, but can you automatically find structrue into data and automatically figure out what are the major types of individuals? Since we're not giving the alogrithm the right answer for the examples in advance, this is unsupervised learning."
