    "Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. What he did was , he had programmed a computer to play maybe tens of thousands of games against itself. And by **watching what sorts of board positions tended to lead to wins, and what positions tended to lead to losses**, the checkers playing program learned over time what good or bad board positions. By trying to **get to bood and avoid bad positions**, this program learned to get better and better at playing checkers.\n",
