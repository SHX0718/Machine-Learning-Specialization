The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from that include the **right answers**, where bu right answer I mean the correct label Y for giver input X. And it's by seeding correct pairs of input X and desired output label Y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and **gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output**."
